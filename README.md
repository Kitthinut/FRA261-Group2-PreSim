## About
This project is a web-based simulation of a 3D exoskeleton golfer body scanning and pressure distribution system.  
It was created purely for study purposes to explore interactive UI, real-time data simulation, and visualization techniques.  
The project may contain experimental code and mock data for testing.

## Features
- 3D body scanner visualization with rotating animation
- Pressure distribution grid for left and right feet
- Dynamic balance indicator and weight metrics
- Multiple view modes: 3D, 2D, and skeleton-only
- Mock sensor data stream and real-time updates
- Animated joints and golf club visualization
- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile screens
